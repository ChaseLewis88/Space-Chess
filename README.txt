
Welcome to Space Chess!

Description:

Space Chess is a player vs player space-themed Chess game.
The humans (green pieces, classically white pieces) defend earth against the invading aliens (red pieces, classically black pieces). 
The game is played on an 8x8 field of dark/light asteroids analogous to a typical Chess board.
All the pieces have the same moveset as in Classical Chess, but with one difference - There are wormholes on the left (blue)
and right (orange) side of the board, and when a piece travels through a wormhole, it comes out of the other one.
Pawn promotion (a pawn reaching the opponent's back line and upgrading to one of the stronger pieces) as well as special moves such as
King/Queenside castling and en passant capturing are allowed (and an en passant capture can even occur through the wormhole!)

Wormhole Mechanics:

Pieces keep their momentum when traveling through the wormhole. For example, a Bishop traveling diagonally through a wormhole
can continue to travel in the same direction through the wormhole if it reaches the side of the board. A Pawn in the A file
(far left of board) can capture a piece right in front of it on the H file (far right) or vice versa using its typical diagonal
capture. A Knight can leap from one side of the board to the other through the wormhole following its normal "L shaped" moveset. 
A Rook can slide along a row through the wormhole and continue its attack on the other side (but can't end in the starting position). 
Queens get the same benefit as Bishops and Rooks combined essentially. Even a King can hop through the wormhole to escape a tight spot,
but can also be put in check / checkmate by being targeted by pieces through the wormholes. The wormholes basically make the game act
as if the left side of the board and right side of the board were stuck right next to each other. Wormholes are not at the top and bottom
sides of board, so a piece cannot move above the asteroid field and come out on the bottom.
Google "Cylinder Chess" if this is confusing because it is basically the same thing.

Gameplay:

Humans move first. Players can press and hold left click on a piece to pick it up and drag it around the screen. They can let go of it on
the asteroid they would like to move it to by releasing left click. The game won't allow the player to pick up the opponent's pieces. If a
player drags and drops a piece out of the asteroid field, to a spot that piece cannot move to, or to an asteroid that would result in their
own King being in check, the piece will be returned to its original position and a relevant statement will be displayed. The player does not
lose their turn. A player may also right click while dragging around a piece (while holding left click) to return the piece to its original
position if they decide they don't want to move it, but they can also just set it back down in its starting location. When a Pawn reaches the
back rank, the 4 pieces it can promote to will appear. The promoting player can left click their desired piece to transform their Pawn into it.
During this time the board is briefly deactivated. The game ends and displays a relevant statement when a player's King is put into Checkmate,
Stalemate, or if there is insufficient material to continue the game. The board becomes deactivated and a new game can be played by restarting 
the program.

Key:

Each side has unique names for their pieces and their movements, usually being a combination of bad puns and sci-fi references. These names
and actions are displayed when players make or attempt to make their moves.
